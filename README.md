Some homemade tools helpful for finding juicy exposed privates, or sniff your own privates. It doesn't judge. DO NOT stick your privates in here if you're shy. This app doesn't transmit your private data, but why risk it?

Joking aside, this software gathers sensitive private data from various sources to compile lists of private keys. During the processing and information gathering, addresses derived from these keys (and possibly the keys themselves!) may be transmitted in an unencrypted format to Russian hackers, Federales, the RCMP (The Realest Crypto Moolah Possee, not cops on horses), there's just no telling where that stuff will end up. I shouldn't need to belabour the point, but it'd be a very bad idea to sniff your own privates if you've got a bunch of eth stuffed down there! These tools weren't meant to rip anyone off and doesn't do anything shady, just be sure you're using an official release. 

This software was created out of boredom and its usefulness is doubtful for anyone but me or someone who wants lists of private keys that have been scoured billions of times over and are good for absolutely nothing but wasting your time looking at zero balances while your girlfriend keeps making sighing noises because she wants your nuts in her guts, but you'd rather keep making steady progress not getting rich! Take my advice, screw your girlfriend before using this software!
